Millions of companies - from the world\u2019s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone&#39;s reach while doing the most important work of your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Web Presence and Platform is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe&#39;s public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe\u2019s front door surfaces, educating customers about the power of our platform, sharing Stripe\u2019s ideas and expertise with the public, and driving adoption. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to update.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Together we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe\u2019s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you\u2019ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer you will concept, prototype, and build new experiences for our web presence. You\u2019ll bring your creativity and expertise to the full range of the Stripe brand, across evergreen pages as well as time-based campaigns. You\u2019ll both utilize and contribute to our libraries and design systems, and when appropriate work outside established systems to create new digital moments. You\u2019ll constantly have in-browser performance in mind, and create abstractions that other designers and engineers consume and build upon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Design Engineers in WPP have a shared commitment to user experience and craft, but each pod has subtly different focus areas. The Collective pod leverages design, animation, and interaction to drive awareness, educate prospective users, and share Stripe\u2019s expertise across public surfaces such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/sessions&quot;&gt;Stripe Sessions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe Press&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.com/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;. The Expansion pod brings the same creativity and executional rigor to attracting new prospects and driving conversion, focusing on user journeys, interactive and highly polished tools for users, and building targeted experiences for our global users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer on the Collective pod with a particular focus on Events, you will help us drive our flagship Sessions event, from promotion and registration to extending the impact of Sessions beyond the in-person event. You will also build experiences to expand our Stripe Tour events and bring Stripe\u2019s expertise to a broader audience. You\u2019ll also collaborate with the broader team to support our other surfaces and missions based on the team\u2019s needs, bringing your meticulous execution to a wide range of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with our team\u2019s designers to prototype and implement web animations and interaction-heavy sites and experiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with other design engineers, pairing, mentoring, and continually building a culture of excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build entire web experiences, including campaigns, event promotions, standalone microsites, and sections of our core sites&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Concept and prototype UX components and motion studies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortably operate within established design systems as well as creating new experiences outside of systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build high-performance web pages&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We&#39;re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

Stripe Revenue Recognition tools enable accountants to automate understanding the impact of complex financial scenarios and avoid manual work, reduce errors, and get accurate reports faster than ever before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stripe Revenue Recognition is part of Stripe\u2019s Revenue and Finance Automation (RFA) suite that gives businesses power over the entire life cycle of their cash flow. By coordinating billing, tax, reporting, and data services in one modern stack, Stripe\u2019s revenue and finance automation suite eliminates the inefficiencies of legacy finance tools and supports revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the internet has been a boon to productivity, the gains have been uneven. Common financial processes like billing, tax, and quarterly reporting are still painfully inefficient and manual. They\u2019re also typically spread across a dozen or more software tools. The result: one-third of finance leaders reopen their books at least once a quarter because of accounting errors, and half spend 10 hours a month manually correcting discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stripe\u2019s RFA suite relieves those burdens by equipping finance leaders with revenue management tools that are as sophisticated as the businesses they run. The suite automates manual work and improves accuracy across the cash flow life cycle, from payments and billing to tax, reporting, and reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our portfolio is growing rapidly and we are expanding our RFA suite to serve the diverse spectrum of Stripe\u2019s users, from brand new startups to public companies. Simultaneously we are investing in foundations for an extensible platform solution, including integrations with external systems that will let us scale our reach and capabilities by orders of magnitude over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What you\u2019ll do&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an experienced full stack engineer to join our team to build products that will streamline and automate accrual accounting for Stripe customers from new venture-backed startups up to some of the biggest household names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scope, architect, and lead technical projects to improve existing features and solve new problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design, build, and maintain user-facing experiences, services, APIs, and systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute against both short- and long-term roadmaps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teach and mentor engineers to grow into the next generation of leaders at Stripe.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with engineers and product managers on infrastructure and other product teams to ensure your features are part of an integrated Stripe suite.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish and uphold best practices in engineering, security, and technical design&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

The BaaS (Banking-as-a-Service) organization is developing two essential components of this evolution:&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/issuing&quot;&gt; Issuing&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/treasury&quot;&gt; Treasury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Issuing is developing new APIs to empower businesses to launch physical and virtual card programs. Treasury enables businesses built on top of our APIs to hold funds, pay bills, earn yield and manage cash flow in more efficient ways. We aim to help businesses deploy novel use cases that rely on fully programmable payment instruments. In recent news, Issuing recently hit a cumulative milestone of &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/patrickc/status/1843411627141673346?s=48&quot;&gt;issuing 200 million cards&lt;/a&gt; to our customers and we\u2019ve enabled a new banking &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/fifth-third&quot;&gt;integration on Treasury with Fifth Third Bank&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Integration Reliability Engineers within the BaaS organization are a dynamic and key component of Stripe&#39;s success.

We built a platform for designing and building great user interfaces called Sail. Whether you\u2019re building a massive web application, embedded UIs, or an SEO-friendly site, Sail has you covered. Sail provides not only a robust design system with reusable components (available in Figma and React), but also all the templates / patterns (e.g. list views, drawers), APIs (e.g. data fetching, access control, observability), and built-in standards (e.g. mobile responsiveness, light/dark mode, embeddability) you need to build a web application. The team is responsible for making web development at Stripe performant, high quality, and easy for developers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re hiring a product manager to define the future of Sail, inflect its impact across the company, and accelerate Stripe\u2019s mission to increase the GDP of the internet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What you\u2019ll do&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will evolve our design system and web platform to be powerful and opinionated so craft &amp;amp; quality are inevitable across Stripe\u2019s products. Lead our frontend design system and components, used by all products. Bring our web platform to the next level on speed and performance. Develop a vision for how our components get used by non-merchant facing teams (e.g. Link for consumers), third-party developers, and platform customers. Bring data to life with powerful real-time charting experiences. Up-level our opinionated product style, in big (new workflows) and small (surprisingly great) ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make the development of products at Stripe faster, easier, and a surprisingly great experience for designers and developers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Partner with senior leadership to understand and uphold our ambitions for quality at scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Develop a strategy and roadmap that transforms Sail into what Stripe will need to achieve its 10-year goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborate with engineering and design across time zones (PST, EST, CET) &amp;nbsp;to ship high impact functionality that delights designers, developers, and users &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Define and track success metrics for quality and performance&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an unorthodox role.

Our customers want a way to manage these accounts under one umbrella so they can operate at scale more efficiently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are responsible for building Organizations, which allows merchants to effectively and centrally manage their businesses across multiple Stripe accounts. As Stripe continues to grow its suite of product offerings beyond payments, Organizations will unlock a new phase of growth for Stripe. We will do this by enabling our platforms and businesses to model their complex businesses and distribute all of Stripe\u2019s products to their end users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can read more about what we are working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-organizations-powering-the-worlds-most-complex-businesses&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (our Stripe Blog).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you\u2019ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a leader on the User Auth Experience team, you will help shape the team\u2019s vision and roadmap, guide and mentor your peers, and lead by example. Authentication, Login, and general Account Security experiences are deeply cross-cutting areas at Stripe with critical security, safety, and quality considerations. You will work with many partner teams: peer engineering organizations to build robust/reusable/standardized access controls, as well as non-engineer groups to shape the security, beauty, and usability of the end-to-end journey of Stripe account authentication. You\u2019ll play a major role in Stripe\u2019s defense strategy, keeping users and data protected from fraudulent activity through intelligently assessing risk and refining user workflows accordingly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an engineer on the team, you\u2019ll directly build well-tested APIs, UX/UI pieces, and analytics engines for defining and measuring the full-stack Dashboard authentication story, elevating the experience for every end user. By creating and expanding these account management \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d, you\u2019ll build out a generalized authentication platform that can be leveraged to bring best-in-class usability and security to multiple Stripe-owned surfaces\u2014multiplying the efforts of product teams to more quickly and confidently build safe, controlled features.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build beautiful web experiences and secure full-stack authentication machinery that impacts millions of users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive sound technical decision-making and lead technical conversations with other teams across Stripe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shape your team\u2019s culture, roadmap, and vision through your guidance, mentorship, foresight, and technical and social expertise.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As a leader within Engineering, assist with growth and development of your team and organization while maintaining a high bar for excellence and technical curiosity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.
