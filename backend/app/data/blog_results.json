Right on. Meanwhile, back in the real world, we all know that the development process never looks like that beautifully clean and unadorned linear path. Rather, it looks more like this: We set off an idea with a full knapsack of sustenance and resources, confident of the direction of our journey. Shortly after, we realise that didn\u2019t read the map quite close enough. Progress stalls as we take time to familiarise ourselves with new concepts or more detailed understanding of existing ones.

If you\u2019re on the fence about hosting a meetup, just do it. Chances are, your community is out there and looking for others with similar interests. Here\u2019s our general strategy for designing/hosting a tech event, and the lessons we\u2019ve learned along the way. Tip #1: Find the gap in your community Browse Meetup.com. Does your developer community exist? Has it been dormant since pre-pandemic? Find a broad focus to center your community around, something that at least a couple thousand locals can relate to, e.g. DevOps, devtools, product management, tech sales, Golang, webapps, Docker, Terraform, etc. From here, you can start collecting names and emails of your friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who are part of this community...",
